OpenConferenceWare
==================


About
-----

*OpenConferenceWare* is an open source web application for supporting conference-like events. This customizable, general-purpose platform provides proposals, sessions, schedules, tracks, user profiles and more.

If you only need a simpler system for accepting proposals for Ignite-like events, please consider the stable and well-tested software this code was forked from: OpenProposals, <http://OpenProposals.org/>


Why
---

By releasing this code under a liberal MIT open source license, we hope to empower other people so they can better organize and participate in more events that support free sharing of information, open society, and involved citizenry.

--------

There is also a `stable` branch that points to the current stable release. The `CHANGES.txt` file describes a summary of significant changes made between releases.

Gotchas
-------

Although this software works well and has been used in production on multiple sites for years, there are a number of issues you should be aware of. It remains under heavy development, documentation is scant, tests are incomplete, and the sample theme is broken. These issues are slowly being resolved.


Installation
------------

Installing this application requires familiarity with *UNIX* system administration and *Ruby on Rails* applications.

This application will run best on a UNIX-based dedicated server or virtual machine, and may not run at all on cheap shared hosting because these often restrict the CPU cycles and memory you're allowed to use below what this application requires.

To install the application and its dependencies:

1. Install Git: <http://git-scm.com/>

2. Checkout the OpenConferenceWare source code:

        git clone git://github.com/igal/openconferenceware.git

3. Install Ruby 1.8.6 or 1.8.7 from <http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/> or Ruby Enterprise Edition from <http://www.rubyenterpriseedition.com/download.html>

4. Install RubyGems 1.3.6 or newer 1.3.x version from <http://rubyforge.org/projects/rubygems>

5. Install Bundler by running the following, likely as `root` or using `sudo`:

        gem install bundler

6. Go into the checkout directory created by `git clone` above:

        cd openconferenceware

7. Install the application's libraries:

        bundle install --without=borked

8. Run the application's interactive setup and follow its instructions:

        rake setup

9. If you intend to setup a production server, you should consider using Phusion Passenger from <http://www.modrails.com/> or Thin <http://code.macournoyer.com/thin/>

10. If you intend to deploy releases to a production server, consider using Capistrano and read the `config/deploy.rb` file.


Security
--------

This application runs with insecure settings by default to make it easy to get started, and will warn you about this each time you start it. These default settings include publicly-known cryptography keys that will let anyone get administrator privileges on your application. To secure your application, create a `config/secrets.yml` file with your secret settings based on the instructions in the `config/secrets.yml.sample` file.


Customization
-------------

You can customize the application's appearance and behavior by creating a theme, read the `themes/README.txt` file.

*WARNING:* If you are running a fork of this software, you should be able to customize everything by modifying the theme and config files. If you find yourself modifying anything else, you may be doing it wrong and should [get in touch](http://github.com/igal/) to discuss if we can figure out a way to make the platform more generic to support your needs.

*WARNING:* The methods and instance variables used within the theme's application layout are in a state of flux as the software evolves. These will be stabilized for the eventual 1.0 release. In the meantime, please watch the changes made to the `bridgepdx` theme's layout and incorporate them into your own, e.g.:

        git log -p themes/bridgepdx/layouts/application.html.erb
